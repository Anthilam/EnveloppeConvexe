The goal of that project is to implements 3 different convex hull algorithms

## Prerequisites

You need to install thoses in order to launch the program :
* [Boost](http://www.boost.org/) - C++ Libraries
* [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) - Used to draw the scatter plot and the hull
* [Freetype](https://www.freetype.org/)

## Running the program

You have to uncomment the algorithm that you want to run in "pilote.c"

Then, you can run the command :
```
cd src
./hull-generator N | ./hull-viewer ./pilote
```
N is the number of points in the scatter plot.
